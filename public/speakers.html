                As a self-proclaimed âUX Unicornâ with strong development and coding skills, Blakeley Kilgore is
                continuously considering the merge between user-facing interfaces and the technologies behind them.
                Kilgore stepped into the web-development scene after a long affair with art and graphic design, allowing
                her natural creativity to make for a unique perspective in the sometimes bland world of coding. As a
                lifelong learner, she holds a B.A. in Liberal Arts from Auburn University and an M.A. in Web Design and
                Online Communication from the University of Florida. She currently works as a front-end web developer
                for Digium, a Sangoma company based in Huntsville, AL, and she is the lecturer for the course âAdvanced
                Web Topics II: Programming and Specialized Topicsâ in the University of Floridaâs graduate school. When
                Kilgore is not working in the online world, creating art, or eating avocado toast, you will find her
                outdoors, most likely near the water, and most likely with her dog.

                Hi [NAME],<br/><br/>

                WeRockIT Conf 2019 is taking place at ADTRAN's Mark C. Smith Conference Center in Huntsville, AL, May
                3-4,
                2019,
                and Iâm hoping to get your approval to go. This is an invaluable opportunity to gain practical
                insights and hear success stories from technology professionals and executives who are facing challenges
                similar to ours. This will be particularly beneficial for [PROJECT 1] and [PROJECT 2]. <br/><br/>

                Beyond that, there will be several opportunities to meet one on one with developers and technology
                professionals from Huntsville and the surrounding areas,
                attend hands-on workshops, learn about the latest trends in technology, and gain technical knowledge.
                I especially look forward to learning about [TOPICS INTERESTED IN] â directly from some of the best and
                brightest in tech â and sharing these insights with our team.<br/><br/>

                I estimate that my attendance at this event will cost [$ HERE] â which includes travel, accommodations,
                and registration. Let me know if youâre on board and we can work together to plan out pre-event and
                post-event action items.<br/><br/>

                Looking forward to your thoughts,<br/>
                [NAME]<br/>
