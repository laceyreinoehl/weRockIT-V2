                    <hr/>
                    <p>
                        The WeRockIT Conf Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put our values into practice. This Code of Conduct is
                        built around the understanding that everything we do in connection with WeRockIT
                        Conf will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical
                        professional conduct. We have set that bar that high for practical as well as aspirational reasons. Our commitment to the
                        highest standards helps us maintain the goals set forth by
                        WeRockIT Conf. Respect for our industry peers, fellow conference go-ers, and for each other are instrumental to
                        our success, and are something we need to support every day.
                    </p>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>
                        We expect board members, volunteers, and conference-goers to respect this Code of Conduct. Additionally,
                        we expect contractors, service providers, consultants, etc. to also conduct themselves in alignment with our
                        ethical and professional standards.
                    </p>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>
                        So please do read this Code of Conduct, and follow both in spirit and letter. And if you have a
                        question or ever think that one of our Board Members, Volunteers, or Conference go-ers, Service Providers, etc. or the
                        conference as a whole may be failing to uphold our commitment, speak out.

                Hi [NAME],<br/><br/>
                WeRockIT Conf 2019 is taking place at ADTRAN's Mark C. Smith Conference Center in Huntsville, AL, May 3-4,
                2019,
                and I’m hoping to get your approval to go. This is an invaluable opportunity to gain practical
                insights and hear success stories from technology professionals and executives who are facing challenges
                similar to ours. This will be particularly beneficial for [PROJECT 1] and [PROJECT 2]. <br/><br/>

                Beyond that, there will be several opportunities to meet one on one with developers and technology
                professionals from Huntsville and the surrounding areas,
                attend hands-on workshops, learn about the latest trends in technology, and gain technical knowledge.
                I especially look forward to learning about [TOPICS INTERESTED IN] – directly from some of the best and
                brightest in tech – and sharing these insights with our team.<br/><br/>


                I estimate that my attendance at this event will cost [$ HERE] – which includes travel, accommodations,
                and registration. Let me know if you’re on board and we can work together to plan out pre-event and
                post-event action items.<br/><br/>

                Looking forward to your thoughts,<br/>
                [NAME]<br/>
